# Market Trail Scout

**Market Trail Scout** is a local, open source market exploration and trade journaling toolkit. It helps traders scan for actionable technical patterns (starting with classic breakout bases), track positions and performance over time, and build rule driven workflows that are fully transparent.

- No black box  
- No subscriptions  
- No pitch at the end  

Built for self directed traders who want real insight, not just alerts.

Inspired by the idea of navigating the financial wilderness with a map worth trusting, Market Trail Scout is both a discovery tool and a trail log.  
**Scout the signals. Mark the path. Learn as you go.**


## Project Origins

Heading into 2020, I was nearing 50 with a typical retirement account for someone who contributed consistently but had not yet played offense with investing. A change in jobs gave me the opportunity to roll my 401(k) into an IRA and for the first time I had full control over what to do with it.

That decision changed everything.

I made a smart (and yes, partly lucky) call and took a position in Nvidia. It was only a fraction of the portfolio, but it gave me a front row seat to what really moves performance.

In the spring of 2025 that same portfolio took a hard hit. You probably know what I am talking about. That moment sent me deep into YouTube, trying to figure out how I could do better.

Among the content overload, one channel stood out: Felix & Friends. I joined one of his Saturday seminars, and if you are not familiar with the breakout trading pattern I recommend it. In about 90 minutes Felix lays out the logic behind the strategy with clarity and conviction.

Then came the catch: access to his full community costs was outside my grasp.

That is when I thought: *I am a programmer. I can build my own tool to find these setups.*

And so, **Market Trail Scout** was born.


## Current Capabilities

At present, Market Trail Scout is a command-line application that pulls financial data, applies strategy filters, and outputs basic trade setup and journaling insights.

The initial module focuses on identifying tight base breakout setups. Additional utilities support trade tagging, journaling, and early-stage performance tracking.

Development is ongoing. The reporting and UX remain in rough form, but the core logic and structure are ready to evolve.


## Opportunities to Contribute

Market Trail Scout is being released as a free, open source project in the spirit of collaboration, transparency, and continuous learning.

Contributions are welcome from:
- **Programmers** interested in building better market tools
- **Traders or analysts** with experience in breakout, trend, or price action strategies
- **New developers or learners** looking for a real project to grow with
- **Testers, reviewers, and curious observers** who want to offer feedback


## Purpose

As Felix often says: *learn the rules so there's no need to rely on others*.

Market Trail Scout is a tool designed to support that journey â€” and to remain free for anyone interested in using or improving it.

If the mission resonates, the trail is open. Let's walk it together.
